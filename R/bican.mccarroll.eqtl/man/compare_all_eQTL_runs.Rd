\title{Compare eQTL results across multiple filtering levels}
\usage{
compare_all_eQTL_runs(
  data_dir,
  outDir = NULL,
  filter_levels = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  fdr_threshold = 0.05,
  cache_dir
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{Character scalar. Base directory containing \code{LEVEL_<n>}
subdirectories.}

\item{outDir}{Character scalar. Output directory for per-comparison PDFs and
summary statistics files.  If the output directory is NULL, this
function returns the combined summary statistics dataframe.}

\item{filter_levels}{Integer vector. Filtering levels to compare. The first
element is used as the baseline level; each subsequent element is compared
against the baseline.}

\item{fdr_threshold}{Numeric scalar. FDR threshold used by downstream
comparison routines (default 0.05).}

\item{cache_dir}{Character scalar. Cache directory used by downstream routines
to avoid re-reading large files.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data.frame of per-dataset summary statistics
  (one row per cell_type/region per comparison). Also writes a combined
  summary file \code{compare_eQTL_all_levels_stats.txt} to \code{outDir}.
}
\description{
Iterates over a set of filtering levels (e.g., LEVEL_0, LEVEL_1, ...) and
performs pairwise comparisons between the first level (baseline) and each
subsequent level. For each comparison, summary statistics are collected and
written to a tab-delimited file in \code{outDir}.
}
\details{
If an output directory is set, this will emit PDFs both for within-level
pair comparisons as well as a full cross-level summary reports and PDFs.
If null, this function will return only the summary level dataframe.
