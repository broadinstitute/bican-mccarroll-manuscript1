\title{Filter covariate tables to a donor subpopulation}
\usage{
filter_covariates_to_subpopulation(inDir, outDir, donorListFile)
}
\arguments{
\item{inDir}{Character scalar. Input directory containing `*covariates.txt`
files.}

\item{outDir}{Character scalar. Output directory to write filtered files. Will
be created if it does not exist.}

\item{donorListFile}{Character scalar. Path to a tab-delimited file whose
first column contains donor IDs matching donor column names in the covariate
tables. The file may have no header.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector of output file paths written.
}
\description{
Read one or more covariate tables from `inDir` and write filtered versions to
`outDir`, keeping only the `id` column and donor columns listed in
`donorListFile` that are present in each file.
}
\details{
Input files are matched by the pattern `covariates\\.txt$`. Output is written
uncompressed (plain text) to `outDir` using the input basenames.
}
