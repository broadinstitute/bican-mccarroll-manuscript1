\title{Plot average silhouette width across k for k-means clustering
(originally plot_k_means_silhouette)}
\usage{
plot_kmeans_silhouette(mat, ks = 10:30)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Numeric matrix used for clustering.
Rows represent the units being clustered (typically genes),
and columns represent features (e.g., scaled log fold-changes).
The matrix should be numeric and is typically centered and scaled
prior to calling this function.}

\item{ks}{Integer vector of cluster numbers (k) to evaluate. Default is 10:30.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Produces a base R plot as a side effect.
}
\description{
Computes k-means clustering across a range of cluster numbers and
visualizes the average silhouette width for each k.
}
\details{
- Euclidean distance is computed on rows of `mat`.
- K-means clustering is performed for k = 10:30.
- For each k, clustering is run with nstart = 200 and iter.max = 20.
- Average silhouette width is computed using cluster::silhouette.
- A line plot of k versus average silhouette width is produced.
