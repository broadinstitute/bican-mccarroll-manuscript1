\title{Compare age DE results between old and strict filtering (ad hoc)}
\usage{
compare_age_de_run(
  cell_type,
  old_data_dir,
  new_data_dir,
  baseline_name = baseline_name,
  comparison_name = comparison_name,
  fdr_cutoff = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_type}{Character scalar. Cell type prefix used to identify
the DE results file in each directory. The function looks for a file
starting with \code{cell_type} and ending in
\code{"_age_DE_results.txt"}.}

\item{old_data_dir}{Character scalar. Directory containing the older,
more permissive age DE result files.}

\item{new_data_dir}{Character scalar. Directory containing the stricter
filtering age DE result files.}

\item{baseline_name}{Character scalar. Name of the baseline filtering level
(e.g., \code{"LEVEL_0"}).}

\item{comparison_name}{Character scalar. Name of the comparison filtering level
(e.g., \code{"LEVEL_3"}).}

\item{fdr_cutoff}{Numeric scalar. FDR threshold used to classify genes
as significant or non-significant in the old run when summarizing
dropped genes. Default is \code{0.05}.}
}
\value{
A combined plot.
}
\description{
This internal helper compares differential expression results for age
between an older, more permissive run and a stricter filtering run for
a single cell type. It:
\itemize{
  \item Reads limma/voom/DREAM result tables from the two directories.
  \item Merges overlapping genes and compares log-fold changes and FDR.
  \item Computes correlation and sign agreement for log-fold changes.
  \item Computes correlation for \eqn{-\log_{10}(\mathrm{FDR})}.
  \item Summarizes genes dropped by the strict filtering, split by
        significance in the old run.
  \item Produces three ggplot2 plots and a combined cowplot layout.

\details{
This function is intended for interactive, ad-hoc inspection and is not
part of the public API.
