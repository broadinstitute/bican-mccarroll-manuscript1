\title{Plot distributions of residual age correlations}
\usage{
plot_residual_age_correlation_distributions(
  corr_results,
  fill_colors = c(`Within region\\n(across cell types)` = "#8DA0CB",
    `Within cell type\\n(across regions)` = "#66C2A5")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr_results}{A list returned by
`compute_residual_age_correlations()`, containing numeric vectors
`within_region` and `within_celltype`.}

\item{fill_colors}{A named character vector specifying fill colors
for the two comparison groups.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Generates a violin plot with embedded boxplots comparing the
distribution of residual age correlations computed within regions
(across cell types) and within cell types (across regions).
This visualization is intended to assess whether donor-specific
variation in residual age is more consistent within a cell type
across regions than across cell types within a region.
