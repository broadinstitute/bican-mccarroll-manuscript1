\title{Compute pairwise residual age correlations within and across cell populations}
\usage{
compute_residual_age_correlations(model_predictions)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_predictions}{A data frame containing corrected residual
age values (`resid_mean_corrected`) along with `cell_type`, `region`,
and `donor` columns.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{within_region}{Pairwise correlations across cell types within regions.}
  \item{within_celltype}{Pairwise correlations across regions within cell types.}
}
}
\description{
Computes pairwise correlations of corrected residual age values
(`resid_mean_corrected`) across two comparison schemes:
(1) between cell types within each region and
(2) between regions within each cell type.
The function returns two numeric vectors containing all pairwise
correlation coefficients for each comparison class.
