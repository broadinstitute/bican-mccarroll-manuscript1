\title{Filter genes by total expression level}
\usage{
filter_top_expressed_genes(dge, gene_filter_frac = 0.5, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A \code{DGEList} object containing raw counts and sample metadata.}

\item{gene_filter_frac}{Numeric scalar between 0 and 1 specifying the
fraction of genes to retain, ranked by total counts. For example,
\code{0.5} retains the top 50\% of genes by expression.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints the number of genes retained
after filtering using \code{logger::log_info()}.}
}
\value{
A filtered \code{DGEList} containing only the selected top-expressed
  genes, with recalculated normalization factors.
}
\description{
Selects the top fraction of genes in a \code{DGEList} based on total read
counts across all samples. The retained genes are those with the highest
overall expression, and normalization factors are recomputed on the filtered
object.
}
\details{
Genes are ranked by their total counts (sum across all samples), and the
top \code{gene_filter_frac} fraction is retained. Library sizes are not kept
from the input object (\code{keep.lib.sizes = FALSE}) to ensure consistency
with the recalculated normalization factors.
