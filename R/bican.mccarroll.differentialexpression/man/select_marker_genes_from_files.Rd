\title{Select marker genes for each cell type (file interface)}
\usage{
select_marker_genes_from_files(
  data_dir,
  data_name,
  cellTypeListFile = NULL,
  markerGeneReportFile,
  high_expression_threshold = 10,
  fold_change = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{Directory containing serialized inputs for
\code{prepare_data_for_marker_genes()}.}

\item{data_name}{Basename/key used by \code{prepare_data_for_marker_genes()} to
locate inputs.}

\item{cellTypeListFile}{Optional file path containing a list of cell types to
include (passed to \code{prepare_data_for_marker_genes()}). If \code{NULL},
uses all cell types present.}

\item{markerGeneReportFile}{Output TSV path. A one-line header beginning with
\code{#} is written first and records \code{high_expression_threshold} and
\code{fold_change}.}

\item{high_expression_threshold}{CPM threshold used to define "expressed in
target" for donor-level pass/fail metrics.}

\item{fold_change}{Minimum per-donor fold change (target / other) required to
count a donor as passing the fold-change criterion.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the marker gene data frame produced by
  \code{\link{select_marker_genes}} (also written to \code{markerGeneReportFile}).
}
\description{
Wrapper around \code{\link{select_marker_genes}} that loads a DGEList from disk
(via \code{prepare_data_for_marker_genes()}) and writes a tab-delimited report
(via \code{write_marker_genes()}).
}
\details{
Marker genes are identified per target cell type by comparing donor-matched CPM
values against every other cell type, then selecting the worst-case comparator
per gene (maximizing donor failures; ties broken by lowest median fold change).
