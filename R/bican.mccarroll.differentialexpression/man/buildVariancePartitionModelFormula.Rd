\title{Build a Variance Partitioning Model Formula}
\usage{
buildVariancePartitionModelFormula(fixedVars, randVars)
}
\arguments{
\item{fixedVars}{Character vector of fixed effect variable names. These will be included
in the formula as standard linear terms.}

\item{randVars}{Character vector of random effect variable names. These will be added to
the formula in the format `(1|var)`, appropriate for use with mixed models.}
}
\value{
An object of class `formula` representing the combined fixed and random effects
  model, with a right-hand side suitable for use in variance partitioning.
}
\description{
Constructs a model formula suitable for use with `variancePartition::fitExtractVarPartModel()`
by combining fixed and random effects into a single right-hand side formula.
