\title{Z-score (center/scale) a training design matrix}
\usage{
.scale_train(M)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{Numeric matrix of shape samples x features.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item \code{X}: z-scored matrix (samples x features).
  \item \code{mu}: numeric vector of feature means.
  \item \code{s}: numeric vector of feature standard deviations (zeros set to 1).
}
}
\description{
Internal helper to z-score features using training-set mean and standard
deviation. Returns the scaled matrix along with the per-feature mean and
standard deviation needed to apply the same scaling to new data.
