\title{Filter an edgeR DGEList to autosomal genes}
\usage{
filter_dge_to_autosomes(dge, contig_yaml_file, reduced_gtf_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{An \code{edgeR::DGEList}. Gene identifiers are expected to be in
\code{rownames(dge)}.}

\item{contig_yaml_file}{Path to a YAML file mapping contig names to contig
classes. Contigs with value \code{"autosome"} are retained.}

\item{reduced_gtf_file}{Path to a tab-delimited file (reduced GTF-like) with
at least the columns \code{chr}, \code{annotationType}, and \code{gene_name}.}
}
\value{
An \code{edgeR::DGEList} containing only rows whose gene names match
autosomal genes in \code{reduced_gtf_file}. Library sizes are preserved
(\code{keep.lib.sizes = TRUE}).
}
\description{
Subsets an \code{edgeR::DGEList} to genes annotated as autosomal. Autosomes are
determined from a contig YAML file (contig \eqn{\rightarrow} class mapping),
and genes are identified from a reduced GTF-like TSV containing gene records.
}
\details{
If either \code{contig_yaml_file} or \code{reduced_gtf_file} is \code{NULL},
the input \code{dge} is returned unchanged.
