\title{Filter a DGEList by library size, plotting the distribution and returning filtered DGEList}
\usage{
filter_by_libsize(dge, threshold_sd = 1.96, bins = 50, strTitlePrefix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A DGEList object containing sample metadata with library sizes}

\item{threshold_sd}{Numeric. Number of standard deviations below the mean to set as the filtering threshold (default 1.96)}

\item{bins}{Integer. Number of bins for the histogram (default 50)}

\item{strTitlePrefix}{Character. Prefix for the plot title (default NULL)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
- `plot`: A ggplot histogram of log10 library sizes with a vertical line at the threshold
- `dge`: The filtered DGEList object retaining only samples with library size above the threshold
}
