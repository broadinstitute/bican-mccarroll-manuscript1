\title{Check that a DGEList has enough features for model fitting}
\usage{
has_min_features(dge, min_features = 2L, context = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A \code{DGEList}.}

\item{min_features}{Integer; minimum number of features (rows) required.}

\item{context}{Optional character string used in log messages
(e.g. cell type name).}
}
\value{
Logical; \code{TRUE} if \code{nrow(dge) >= min_features}, otherwise
  \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Internal guard to ensure that downstream modeling steps (e.g. glmnet)
have a sufficient number of features. Intended to be used to short-circuit
model fitting for cell types with too few genes after filtering.
