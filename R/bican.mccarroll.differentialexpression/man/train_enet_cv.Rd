\title{Train Elastic Net age model with K-fold cross-validation}
\usage{
train_enet_cv(
  dge_train,
  k_fold_index,
  age_col = "age",
  donor_col = "donor",
  alpha_fixed = 0.5,
  refit_model_all_data = T,
  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge_train}{A DGEList object containing log-CPM data for training.}

\item{k_fold_index}{Named integer vector: donor IDs mapped to fold number.}

\item{age_col}{Column in dge$samples giving donor age.}

\item{donor_col}{Column in dge$samples giving donor ID.}

\item{alpha_fixed}{Elastic net alpha (0=L2 ridge, 1=L1 lasso).}

\item{refit_model_all_data}{If set to true, refit the final model using all of the data.
If set to false, the final model is obtained by averaging the per-fold model coefficients.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item per_fold — metrics for each CV fold.
  \item oof — per-donor predicted and true ages.
  \item overall — combined metrics across all folds.
  \item coef_matrix — feature × fold coefficient table.
  \item intercepts — intercept per fold.
  \item scaling — mean and sd of each feature per fold.
