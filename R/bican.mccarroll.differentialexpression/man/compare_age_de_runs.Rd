}
\arguments{
\item{old_data_dir}{Directory containing age DE result files from the old run.}

\item{new_data_dir}{Directory containing age DE result files from the new run.}

\item{baseline_name}{Name of the baseline group used in the DE analysis.}

\item{comparison_name}{Name of the comparison group used in the DE analysis.}

\item{outPDF}{Path to a PDF file for saving plots. If NULL, no PDF is written.}

\item{outFile}{Path to a tab-delimited file for saving the summary table.
If NULL, no file is written.}

\item{fdr_cutoff}{FDR threshold used to define significant genes.}
}
\value{
A list containing summary statistics and plots produced by
  \code{plot_summary()}.
}
\description{
Compare age-related differential expression results between an old and a new
analysis run across multiple cell types. Generates summary plots and an
aggregated results table, with optional PDF and tab-delimited output.
