\usage{
age_prediction_mean_residual_correlation_plots(
  cellTypeListFile = NULL,
  metacell_dir = NULL,
  data_name = "donor_rxn_DGEList",
  age_de_results_dir = NULL,
  contig_yaml_file = NULL,
  reduced_gtf_file = NULL,
  n_cores = 14,
  data_cache_dir = NULL,
  outDir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cellTypeListFile}{Path to a text file containing one cell type per
line. If \code{NULL}, resolved under the data root.}

\item{metacell_dir}{Directory containing metacell objects used for age
prediction. If \code{NULL}, resolved under the data root.}

\item{data_name}{Name of the DGEList object to load from the metacell
directory.}

\item{age_de_results_dir}{Directory containing age differential expression
results used in model construction. If \code{NULL}, resolved under the
data root.}

\item{contig_yaml_file}{Path to the contig YAML file. If \code{NULL},
resolved under the data root.}

\item{reduced_gtf_file}{Path to the reduced GTF file. If \code{NULL},
resolved under the data root.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel computation.}

\item{data_cache_dir}{Directory for cached intermediate data. If
\code{NULL}, resolved via configured cache directory options.}

\item{outDir}{Output directory for the generated SVG plot. If \code{NULL},
resolved via configured output directory options.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its
  side effect of writing an SVG plot to disk.
}
\description{
Computes, for each cell type, the correlation between chronological age
and residual predicted age (predicted minus chronological age after
correction), and generates a distribution plot summarizing these
correlations. The resulting SVG file is written to the specified output
directory.
}
\details{
All file path arguments may be \code{NULL}, in which case they are resolved
via \code{.resolve_age_pred_paths()} using the configured data root,
cache, and output directory options.
