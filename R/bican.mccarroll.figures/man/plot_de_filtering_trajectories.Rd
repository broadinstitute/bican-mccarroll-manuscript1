\title{Clustered trajectories of DE gene discovery across filtering levels}
\usage{
plot_de_filtering_trajectories(
  data_dir = NULL,
  data_name = "donor_rxn_DGEList",
  data_cache_dir = NULL,
  cellTypeListFile = NULL,
  outDir = NULL,
  clustering_min_genes = 150,
  num_clusters = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{Directory containing per-level DE results used by
`bican.mccarroll.differentialexpression::compare_all_age_de_runs()`.}

\item{data_name}{Included for interface symmetry with other figure functions;
not used by the current implementation.}

\item{data_cache_dir}{Directory used to store and read cached intermediate
data for this figure.}

\item{cellTypeListFile}{Path to a one-column text file listing cell types to
include in the plot. Cell types not present in the data are reported via a
warning.}

\item{outDir}{Output directory for the SVG. If `NULL`, no file is written.}

\item{clustering_min_genes}{Minimum baseline discovery required for a cell
type to be included in clustering and plotting.}

\item{num_clusters}{Number of clusters to use when grouping cell types by
trajectory.}
}
\value{
Returns `NULL` invisibly. This function is called for its side
  effects (plot generation and optional SVG export).
}
\description{
Generate a summary figure showing how the number of
significantly age-associated genes changes as increasingly stringent filtering
is applied across differential expression runs. The function loads or computes
a table of gene discovery counts across filtering levels, subsets to a
configured list of cell types, filters to cell types with sufficient baseline
discovery for clustering, clusters trajectories, and then draws a faceted
panel plot.
}
\details{
To avoid repeatedly recomputing the underlying summary data, this function
maintains a tab-delimited cache in `data_cache_dir`. When the cache file is
present, it is read and used directly. When missing, the function calls
`bican.mccarroll.differentialexpression::compare_all_age_de_runs()` to
regenerate the data and writes the cache before plotting.

When `outDir` is not `NULL`, the figure is saved as `de_filtering_plot.svg` in
`outDir`. When `outDir` is `NULL`, the plot is constructed but not saved.
