\title{Parse differential expression result tables from a directory}
\usage{
parse_de_inputs(in_dir, file_pattern = "age", cellTypeListFile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{in_dir}{Character scalar. Directory containing DE result files.}

\item{file_pattern}{Character scalar. Pattern used to select files from
`in_dir` via `list.files(..., pattern = file_pattern)`.}

\item{cellTypeListFile}{Character scalar or `NULL`. Optional path to a text file
containing one cell type per line. If provided, only files whose basenames
start with one of the listed cell types (after appending
`paste0("_", file_pattern)`) are retained. Default `NULL`.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, one per retained DE result file. Each data frame
corresponds to a condition or cell type, with names derived from the input file
names after suffix and token simplification.
}
\description{
Read multiple differential expression (DE) result files from a directory,
optionally restrict them to a specified list of cell types, and derive concise,
human-readable condition names from the file names.

Files are selected using a filename pattern (for example, `"age"`), read with
`read.table()`, and returned as a named list of data frames. Names are simplified
by removing a common suffix and any tokens shared across all inputs.
