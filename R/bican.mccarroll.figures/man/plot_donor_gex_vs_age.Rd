\item{cell_metadata_file}{Path to annotated cell metadata. If NULL, resolved by resolver.}

\item{metacells_file}{Path to metacells DGEList counts. If NULL, resolved by resolver.}

}
\value{
Invisibly NULL.

\description{
These plots show a number of genes expression values for each
donor as heatmaps, with donors ordered by age.  This demonstrates
some of the age DE pathways we observe using fairly raw data to
demonstrate that patterns are observable without heavy processing.
}
\details{
The scatterplot grid shows the same data as the heatmaps,
but with one point per donor and a Spearman correlation

This function computes all required intermediate objects (with RDS caching)
and then generates the manuscript plots and saves them as SVG files.
