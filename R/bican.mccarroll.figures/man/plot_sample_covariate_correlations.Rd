\usage{
plot_sample_covariate_correlations(
  metacell_dir = NULL,
  data_name = "donor_rxn_DGEList",
  randVars = c("donor", "imputed_sex", "biobank", "single_cell_assay", "region",
    "hbcac_status", "toxicology_group"),
  fixedVars = c("age", "PC1", "PC2", "PC3", "PC4", "PC5", "pmi_hr", "pct_intronic",
    "frac_contamination"),
  outDir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metacell_dir}{Directory containing the input objects used by the analysis
package to prepare plotting data.}

\item{data_name}{Basename of the input object (as expected by the analysis
package) used to load and prepare the `DGEList`.}

\item{randVars}{Character vector of random-effect covariate names passed to
the analysis data-prep step.}

\item{fixedVars}{Character vector of fixed-effect covariate names passed to
the analysis data-prep step.}

\item{outDir}{Output directory for the SVG file. If `NULL`, the plot is drawn
to the active graphics device and no file is written.}
}
\value{
This function is called for its side effects and returns `NULL`
  invisibly. The primary outputs are the plotted figure and, optionally, an
  SVG file saved to `outDir`.
}
\description{
Compute pairwise correlations among sample-level covariates used for the
analysis model and draw a publication-formatted correlation plot. This is
intended as a figure-generation wrapper that delegates data preparation and
correlation computation to the analysis package, then applies consistent
labeling, ordering, and output settings for the manuscript.
}
\details{
The correlation matrix is computed from the `samples` table of a prepared
`DGEList` using `bican.mccarroll.differentialexpression::getVariableCorrelation()`.
Covariate names are mapped to human-readable labels, then reordered into
conceptual groups (for example donor, sample, and cell QC) before plotting
with `corrplot::corrplot()`. When `outDir` is not `NULL`, the plot is written
to an SVG file.
